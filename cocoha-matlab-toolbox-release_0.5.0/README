Synopsis
--------
This toolbox was written to standardize MATLAB data storage and analysis for the COCOHA project.
The data structure is based loosely on FieldTrip's, but allows for the storage of multiple data
sources (e.g. audio/EEG) and provides flexibility in defining dimensions (e.g. channel, time, 
frequency, rate, scale, etc). Moreover, function calls that modify the contents of the data 
structure will append their user-defined parameters to the data.cfg cell array. This allows for
traceability of results.

The functions in the toolbox allow for external functions to operate on the data structure in a 
robust and standardized way.

The MATLAB components are designed for offline prototyping of decoding strategies. On the other
hand, realtime processing is primarily implemented with OpenViBE Python scripts. OpenViBE is used as
it provides drift correction, and its support for object-oriented programming allows better
modularity.


Installation
------------
Add main directory to the MATLAB path and run co_defaults on the MATLAB command line.


MATLAB Data Structure Specifications
------------------------------------
Data stored in the data structure (e.g. audio/EEG in the example below) can take on any user-
defined field name in the form of data.FIELD, where FIELD is the field name of the data source 
(i.e. wav or eeg). FIELD must not share the same name as any dimension label. Trials are stored as 
cells in the form of .FIELD{TRIAL}. In the example, the EEG data has two trials. The length of 
each trial does not need to be the same under this schema. Sample rates for each data type are 
stored under .fsample.FIELD.

Dimension information is stored in the .dim field. The dimension types (e.g. time, chan) are 
stored in the .dim.FIELD. The specification of their axis values is optional. They can be specified 
under .dim.DIM.FIELD{TRIAL}, where DIM is the name of the dimension (i.e. freq). The axis values 
should be stored as either a cell array of strings or numbers (and not a cell with a numeric array).
The 'time' dimension has a special significance as many signal processing functions operate on this
dimension. Additionally, any operations on this dimension will affect the .fsample and .event
fields.

Event/trigger/stimulation values for each data field are stored in the .event.FIELD structure array.
.event.FIELD(TRIAL).sample is an array indexes of samples at which each event occured.
.event.FIELD(TRIAL).value is a cell array containing a corresponding value for each event sample.
The values can either be a string or numeric, and are meant to assist the user in sorting different
types of events.

            .eeg{1}   = {'A1', 'A2', 'CZ'}

Function Specifications
-----------------------
Functions belonging to the toolbox generally are prefixed with 'co_', except for private or 
external functions. Similar to FieldTrip, all functions take a cfg structure as their first 
argument. The cfg structure contains parameters passed to the function. The data source (e.g. eeg 
or wav) being operated on is specified by cfg.FIELD.param. Functions that alter the data will 
append the cfg structure to the cfg cell array in the data, along with the name of the function and 
the date of execution in the cfg.fcn and cfg.date fields.
